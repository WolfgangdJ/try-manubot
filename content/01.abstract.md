## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Manubot is an open source tool for writing manuscripts on GitHub in markdown format.
Manubot applies the git-based software workflow to scholarly writing, enabling enhanced transparency, collaboration, automation, and reproducibility.

This manuscript is a Manubot demo, intended to give users a playground to practice using Manubot.
Everyone is encouraged to try writing with Manubot by editing this manuscript.

Manubot is described in the paper titled "Open collaborative writing with Manubot" [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/].

Let us try to generalize the dynamics of the hydrogen molecule at a fixed center of mass clamped between two point-like STM tips [@url:https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11619] to the case of unrestricted center of mass motion between those tips. The three additional 
degrees of freedom should increase the length of a QMC run by a factor 3 to obtain a similar variance provided an approximate linear scaling is obeyed. Here, we investigate tips of equal negative charge. From the electrostatic point of view the tips yield for a neutral polarizable object as H2 a rather flat potential trough halfway betwen the tips. The quantum mechnical calculation, however, leads along the tip-tip direction to an extremely flat minimum in contrast to the steep lateral potential curvature for the oscillation of the center of mass.
